*   **pip:** Python package installer (usually comes with Python).
*   **Git:** To clone the repository.

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

Follow these steps to get your bot up and running:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/frenkiofficial/Crypto-Trading-Bot.git
    cd Crypto-Trading-Bot
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    It's recommended to use a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    # Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
    python -m venv venv
    # Activate it (Linux/macOS)
    source venv/bin/activate
    # Activate it (Windows)
    .\venv\Scripts\activate

    # Install required packages
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(If `requirements.txt` doesn't exist yet, create one with the following content):*
    ```txt
    # requirements.txt
    python-telegram-bot>=20.0
    requests
    ```

3.  **Configure Bot Token:**
    *   Open the `crypto_bot.py` file (or the main bot script).
    *   Find the line `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN = "YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN"`.
    *   Replace `"YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN"` with the actual token you got from BotFather.
    *   **Important:** Keep your bot token secret! Do not commit it directly into your public repository if you plan to fork or modify publicly. Consider using environment variables for better security in production environments.

4.  **Run the Bot:**
    ```bash
    python crypto_bot.py
    ```
    You should see log messages in your console indicating the bot has started polling.

## 🚀 Usage

Once the bot is running, open Telegram and find the bot you created with BotFather. You can interact with it using the following commands:

*   `/start`
    *   Displays a welcome message and basic command information.
*   `/price <COIN_SYMBOL>`
    *   Example: `/price SOL`
    *   Replies with the current USD price of the specified cryptocurrency (e.g., Solana). Uses common symbols like BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, etc.
*   `/alert <COIN_SYMBOL> <TARGET_PRICE>`
    *   Example: `/alert BTC 70000`
    *   Sets an alert. The bot will send you a direct message when the price of Bitcoin (BTC) reaches or exceeds $70,000 USD.
*   `/listalerts`
    *   Shows a list of all the price alerts you have currently set up with this bot.
